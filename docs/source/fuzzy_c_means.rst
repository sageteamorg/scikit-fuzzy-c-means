Fuzzy C-Means
=============

What is Fuzzy C-Means?
----------------------
Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a clustering algorithm that assigns data points to clusters with varying degrees of membership. Unlike traditional clustering methods like k-means, where each data point belongs to exactly one cluster, FCM allows for partial membership, which is especially useful for handling data with overlapping clusters.

Mathematical Definition
-----------------------
The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm minimizes the following objective function:

.. math::

   J_m = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{C} u_{ij}^m \| x_i - c_j \|^2

where:

- :math:`N` is the number of data points.
- :math:`C` is the number of clusters.
- :math:`u_{ij}` is the degree of membership of data point :math:`x_i` in cluster :math:`j`.
- :math:`m > 1` is the fuzziness coefficient.
- :math:`\| x_i - c_j \|` is the Euclidean distance between data point :math:`x_i` and cluster center :math:`c_j`.

The algorithm iteratively updates the membership matrix and cluster centers to minimize :math:`J_m`.

Algorithm Overview
-------------------
The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm operates as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the membership matrix :math:`U` randomly or using a method like k-means++.

2. **Update Cluster Centers**:
   - Compute cluster centers :math:`c_j` using the formula:

     .. math::

        c_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{ij}^m x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{ij}^m}

3. **Update Membership Matrix**:
   - Update the degree of membership for each data point:

     .. math::

        u_{ij} = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{C} \left( \frac{\| x_i - c_j \|}{\| x_i - c_k \|} \right)^{\frac{2}{m-1}}}

4. **Convergence Check**:
   - Check if the membership matrix :math:`U` has stabilized by measuring the change between iterations. Stop if the change is below a predefined threshold :math:`\epsilon`.

Membership Functions in FCM
---------------------------
Fuzzy C-Means uses the concept of membership degrees to determine how closely a data point belongs to a cluster. The degree of membership depends on the distance between the data point and cluster centers.

Distance Metric
---------------
FCM typically uses the Euclidean distance as the metric to measure how far a data point is from a cluster center.

.. math::

   \| x_i - c_j \| = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{d} (x_{ik} - c_{jk})^2}

where :math:`d` is the dimensionality of the data.

Fuzziness Coefficient
---------------------
The fuzziness coefficient :math:`m` controls the level of fuzziness in the clustering process. A higher value of :math:`m` leads to more overlap between clusters, while a value closer to 1 makes the clustering behavior more like k-means.

Applications of Fuzzy C-Means
-----------------------------
Fuzzy C-Means has applications in various fields:

- **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning images into meaningful regions, e.g., identifying tissues in medical imaging.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Classifying data with overlapping characteristics, such as handwriting recognition.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Identifying abnormal regions in MRI or CT scans.
- **Data Mining**: Extracting insights from complex datasets with fuzzy boundaries.
