Features of FuzzyCMeans
-----------------------

- **Fuzzy Membership**: Assigns data points to clusters with varying degrees of membership, offering more flexibility than hard clustering.
- **Scikit-Learn Compatibility**: Integrates with Scikit-Learn, allowing usage with pipelines and transformers.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows adjustment of key parameters like the number of clusters, fuzziness coefficient, convergence tolerance, and maximum iterations.
- **Reproducibility**: Supports setting a random seed to ensure reproducible results.

Use Cases
---------

1. **Image Segmentation**: Clustering regions of images based on characteristics like color or intensity.
2. **Market Segmentation**: Grouping customers into soft clusters based on purchasing behavior.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying potential outliers as data points with low membership across all clusters.
4. **Genomics**: Classifying species or genes when relationships are ambiguous.
